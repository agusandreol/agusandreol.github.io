	"about" : "This biennial exhibition starts where our open call ended: with the sentence “Let’s try listening again.” Echoing a contemporary sentiment, this title voices an urge to stop the treadmill of self-same thought and perceive what is near, around, yet not always seen. It highlights a pause for respect and discovery that is necessary to imagine new, relevant relations—whether social, intellectual, emotional, or cosmic. The point being: we can’t know everything, but still we need to envision novel forms of communing. \nListening to the five hundred and forty-four voices that responded to our open call, we gradually selected a constellation of twenty-nine works that resonate with this theme. The exhibition brings together two performances, two distributed projects, and twenty-five works for the gallery by participating artists far and wide. \nThe encoded PDF communiqués made on this catalog-website provide visual glimpses of the exhibition and short writings around the thematics of this year’s biennial.\n\nGratitude to all applicants. This was hard.\nS. & P.",
